# To-Do List with Deadlines
# This is a simple To-Do list project in Python, suitable for beginners.

# What was added:
# - Each task has a deadline, stored as "task_name;deadline" in the file.
# - When adding a task, the user inputs both the name and the deadline.
# - Tasks are displayed with their deadlines.

# Functions in the code:
# 1. load_tasks() – loads tasks from "tasks.txt" when the program starts.
# 2. save_tasks() – saves the current tasks with deadlines back to the file.
# 3. show_tasks() – displays all tasks with their number and deadline.

# Skills practiced:
# - Working with functions
# - Using lists and tuples
# - Loops (while, for)
# - User input/output (input)
# - File handling (reading/writing)
# - Basic menu-driven program logic

# Program features:
# - Show all tasks
# - Add a new task with a deadline
# - Remove a task by number
# - Save changes to the file
# - Exit the program

# Future features to add:
# - Edit tasks – change task name or deadline
# - Sort tasks by deadline – show nearest deadlines first
# - Mark tasks as completed – track completed vs pending tasks
# - Search tasks – filter tasks by keyword or date
# - Notifications/reminders – alert user of upcoming deadlines
